Automated Book Publication Workflow
Objective: Create a system to fetch content from a web URL, apply an AI-driven "spin" to chapters, allow multiple human-in-the-loop iterations. 

Key Capabilities:
1.Scraping & Screenshots: Fetch content and save screenshots https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Gates_of_Morning/Book_1/Chapter_1. with RL Based Reward system
2.AI Writing & Review: Use LLMs (e.g., Gemini or any ) for chapter "spinning" by an AI Writer and refinement by an AI Reviewer.
3.Human-in-the-Loop: Facilitate multiple iterations with human input for writers, reviewers, and editors before finalization and ensure RL Based inference technique is used
4.Agentic API: Ensure seamless content flow between AI agents with voice support with version support with semantic search
with RL Based reward model

Core Tools:
Python: ,Playwright: For web scraping and screenshots.LLM: For AI writing, reviewing, and editing.ChromaDB: For content versioning and search.
RL Search Algorithm: For consistent data retrieval.
